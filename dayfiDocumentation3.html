                <h3>Use Case.</h3>
                <h5>Conceptually, NFT renting is as simple as its name suggests. Individuals who do not own a particular NFT, but would either like to use it or experience it for a limited time.</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Gaming ( Q1 & Q2 ) :</b> People can lease their NFTs or game collectibles to other players who are interested in leasing them. In fact, Axie Infinity is one of the games where leasing NFT is already a common practice. In another example, a player may rent out weapons or in-game assets that they may not be using, to earn passive income.</li>
                    <div class="cont-img"><img src="assets/doc3img1.jpeg"></div>
                    <li><b>Metaverse and Digital Land:</b> People and developers are buying digital land, indicating that NFT land leasing industry will soon emerge. As people spend more time on metaverse, participants will be interested in setting up digital stores or building virtual homes, just like in the real world. “Digital landlord” may soon become a reality.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Virtual land rentals in The Sandbox, Axie Infinity, Decentraland. Desired locations etc</li>
                        <li>Scarce and rare in game items. Assets such as swords that boost character power/playability. Items to help advance/beat certain levels of games.</li>
                        <li>In game exclusive limited wearables/digital fashion NFTs</li>
                        <li>Advancing play to earn game mechanisms. IE: Higher tier limited edition Cometh spaceships could be rented to players to advance further easier, which in turn earns more spaceships that can be sold</li>
                        <li>Virtual ad space rentals, metaverse in game billboards could be rented even daily on large experience plots in high traffic areas</li>
                        <li>Aavegotchi rare wearables to boost your rarity</li>

                    <li><b>NFT ticketing & renting :</b> NFT ticketing will foster the airing of exclusive content beyond the traditional method embraced by streaming services.<br><br>By combining NFTs and PPV, organizers can make revenue directly from the sale of NFT tickets, while airing the live show at a dedicated landing site. Though in the beginning, this might not generate as much attention or buzz as the conventional methods might, it will certainly help organizers to maximize their revenue potential as time goes on. <br><br>World´s First NFT Pay-Per-View Sport Event to be held in Dubai</li>
